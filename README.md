# Simple Todos API with Node.js and Express

I make a simple todos api with Node.js and Express as purposed to learn backend and API technology.


Thanks to the [Laith Harb](https://github.com/harblaith7) to guide this tutorial, which is I was followed along the [Express JS (Node REST API) Crash Course](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=P5q8rUGCN9k) on his YouTube channel.


To test this API locally, you need to have [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/en/) installed on your local machine. Then, kindly download the zip file of the source code. After extract the folder, open the terminal and type

```Shell
	npm install
	// This will install all the dependencies of the project
```


I have use Nodemon along this API development. To run this API using Nodemon, simply type

```Shell
  npm run dev
```


or, you can use built-in Node.js server. Just type

```Shell
  node index.js
```
